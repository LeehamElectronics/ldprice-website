## This repo contians the software I wrote for my public website, ldprice.com

#

I am still actively developing this website along with it's subdomain sites,  https://cleaning.ldprice.com and  https://tuition.ldprice.com for the two small business I run to help support me in my STEM career. 

 https://ldprice.com will be more of a general overview of my work and services for building a bit of a public profile / resume builder ect, the two sub domains are purely business related.
