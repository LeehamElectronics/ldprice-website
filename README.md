## This repo contians the software I wrote for my personal website.

I am still actively developing this website along with it's subdomain sites, [cleaning.ldprice.com](https://www.cleaning.ldprice.com) and  [tuition.ldprice.com](https://www.tuition.ldprice.com) for the two small business I run to help support me in my STEM career. 

 [ldprice.com](https://www.ldprice.com) will be more of a general overview of my work and services for building a bit of a public profile / resume builder ect, the two sub domains are purely business related.
