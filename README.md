## This repo contains the code for my personal website.

#

I am still actively developing this website along with it's subdomain sites, [cleaning.ldprice.com](https://www.cleaning.ldprice.com) and  [tuition.ldprice.com](https://www.tuition.ldprice.com) for the two small businesses I run. 

 [ldprice.com](https://www.ldprice.com) is a general overview of some of my work and projects, the two sub domains are purely business related.
